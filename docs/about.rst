About The Wire Clippers 5902
========

Team 5902, The Wire Clippers, is a collaboration between Portsmouth High School and New Heights.  We were founded on October 1, 2015 with our rookie year in 2016.  Our team began with 13 members, increasing by ten by the next season.  Team members currently mentor FLL and FLLJr. teams, to foster a love of FIRST and STEM at a young age.  Our team is also active in various community events involving us to talk to the public including potential mentors and sponsors.  We find it important to build a positive reputation for our team, Portsmouth High School, and New Heights. 

Team Structure
--------

Because we are a fairly small team, team members often belong to more than one sub team.  Our main sub-teams are marketing and business, awards, programming, mechanical (1,2,3), electrical, bumpers, strategy, drive team, branding, and scouting.  Mentors usually oversee one or more groups, often related to their field of work, where they aid students in managing all aspects of the team and the robot from CAD to finances.  Most teams have a mix of rookie and veteran members so students can learn from their peers in addition to the team mentors.
